TensorFlow Reinforcemente Learning
***************************************

This project is the demo, training, toy, whatever for the preparation of
Wittylytic's DataSci Team on the building of a Recommendation System 

Objectives
===========

* Test tensorflow 2.0 and tensorboard
* Test small datasets and performance of classical supervised and
unsupervised algorithm.
* Test serving a model as a microservices.
* Test tensorflow-serving with the same models.
* Test the AWS platform to serv the same microservices.
* Create metrics to evaluate and suggest technical issues to the 
infraestructure team and the...
* IT Strategy Consulting clients
* To document the math mecanism that sustain every kind of NN used to 
study-remember-reuse faster those math in new Apps.
